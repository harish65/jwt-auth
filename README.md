 Building a basic API structure with Node.js involves setting up routes, handling HTTP requests, and defining responses. Below is a simple outline of a Node.js API structure:
 Project Setup: Start by creating a new Node.js project and initializing it with npm or yarn.
 Dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies. For a basic API, you might need Express, a popular web application framework for Node.js.
 Project Structure: Create a folder structure for your API. A basic structure could look like this:

Project Folder Structure Is 
RouteFolder
          index.js
          database.js
         -Controllers
           --userController.js
         -routes
           --api.routes.js


Steps To Start
 Git Pull Origin master
 Npm init
 npm i express
 node index.js
 URL : http://yourULR/api/users
